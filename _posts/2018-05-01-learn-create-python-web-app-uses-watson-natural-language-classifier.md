Natural language classification (NLC) is related to the field of [natural language processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing), and other related technologies include natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG). IBM Watsonâ„¢ provides a cloud-based service aptly called [Watson Natural Language Classifier](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-language-classifier/), which allows a developer to create classifiers for text, and using cognitive computing techniques, it will return the best matching predefined classifier.

The easiest way I found to wrap my head about NLC was to use the sample data in the [Getting started tutorial](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/natural-language-classifier/getting-started.html). You can watch a walk-through [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUj826ybCdU) of that tutorial, which uses Watson Natural Language Classifier to classify questions about weather. In the tutorial, we have a small dataset of text input to act as our training data. The training data includes sentences we train as part of the `weather` class, such as "How is the weather outside?" or "Is it snowing?" and sentences we train as part of the `temperature` class, such as "What's the temperature outside?" or "Is it cold outside?" Using even a small dataset, we can see fairly high accuracy to questions not in our training data - questions that involve "blizzard" or "rain," for instance.

We recently created a "[Classify ICD-10 data with Watson](http://developer.ibm.com/code/patterns/classify-icd-10-data-with-watson)" code pattern to take things a bit further. We created a small Python-based web app and used a much larger dataset - specifically, the [ICD-10 dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10), which classifies medical diagnoses to an ICD-10 designation. Check out the code in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/IBM/nlc-icd10-classifier) - fork it, clone it, modify it to fit your use case.

It's not hard to imagine a scenario where text classification could be useful. Classifying email, tweets, or posts as spam or malicious is an easy-to-understand example. Perhaps we could use Watson Natural Language Classifier to look up FAQs or other documents (like ICD-10).
