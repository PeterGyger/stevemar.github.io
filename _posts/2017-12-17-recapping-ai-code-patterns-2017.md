## What is Watson Conversation?

[Watson Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/conversation) is used to quickly build and deploy chatbots and virtual agents across a variety of channels, including mobile devices, messaging platforms, and even robots. It is available as an IBM Cloud service and is most commonly used via a web interface. The web interface allows users to easily setup their entities and intents, conversation flow, export their workspace (as a JSON file) to share with others, and even test their conversation in the tool.

## Use Cases

So, what can you use Watson Conversation for? Aside from creating a chatbot, that’s the obvious choice, what else can you use it for? How about the following:

*   [As a substitute for a controller in a video game](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/create-a-virtual-reality-speech-sandbox)
*   [A way to interact with your home assistant](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/create-an-alexa-skill-with-serverless-and-a-conversation)
*   [A way to interact with a robotic device](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/sports-buddy-tjbot-watson-discovery)

## IBM Code Patterns related to Watson Conversation

If you're unfamiliar with IBM Code Patterns, they are reproducible examples that are hosted on Github and free to use (they often work on IBM Cloud's free-tier too!). They contain detailed documentation on how to deploy and run the application, and a video to explain things. Below are the patterns we released in 2017 that relate to Watson Conversation.

*   [Create a cognitive retail chatbot with a Slack frontend](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/create-cognitive-retail-chatbot)
*   [Create a cognitive banking chatbot](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/create-cognitive-banking-chatbot)
*   [Assemble a pizza-ordering chatbot dialog](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/assemble-a-pizza-ordering-chatbot-dialog)
*   [Create a virtual reality speech sandbox](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/create-a-virtual-reality-speech-sandbox)
    *   Which includes support for [HTC Vive](https://github.com/ibm/vr-speech-sandbox-vive), [Google Cardboard](https://github.com/ibm/vr-speech-sandbox-cardboard), and [Oculus Rift](https://github.com/ibm/vr-speech-sandbox-rift)!
*   [Create a sports buddy with TJBot and Watson](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/sports-buddy-tjbot-watson-discovery)
*   [Create an Alexa skill with serverless and a conversation](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/create-an-alexa-skill-with-serverless-and-a-conversation)

## What to expect in 2018?

Expect more Code Patterns for Watson Conversation for various industry segments, integrated with different backends, and more ports of our famous speech sandbox.If you're interested in reading more about IBM Code Patterns check out my other blogs about Watson Discovery, Watson Visual Recognition, Watson Data Platform, and PowerAI.

## What is Watson Data Platform?

[Watson Data Platform](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/watson-data-platform/) is a set of data and analytics features, all available on IBM Cloud. It’s easy to choose a combination of services that application developers, data scientists, and data engineers can use to complement your existing architecture and compose business solution. Whether this is preparing your data with the IBM Data Catalog; storing your data in Cloudant; analyzing it with the IBM Data Science Experience; creating an application with Watson Maching Learning; Watson Data Platform has you covered!

## Use Cases

So, what can you use Data Platform for?

*   [Analyze data with the Data Science Experience](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/analyze-san-francisco-traffic-data-with-ibm-pixiedust-and-data-science-experience)
*   Leverage the latest in sync'ing your data by creating an offline first app

## IBM Code Patterns related to Watson Data Platform

If you're unfamiliar with IBM Code Patterns, they are reproducible examples that are hosted on Github and free to use (they often work on IBM Cloud's free-tier too!). They contain detailed documentation on how to deploy and run the application, and a video to explain things. Below are the patterns we released in 2017 that relate to Watson Data Platform.

*   [Analyze traffic data from the city of San Francisco](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/analyze-san-francisco-traffic-data-with-ibm-pixiedust-and-data-science-experience)
*   [Analyze Tweets with Jupyter Notebooks](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/analyze-twitter-jupyter-notebooks)

## What is Watson Visual Recognition?

[Watson Visual Recognition](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/visual-recognition) is used to quickly and accurately tag, classify and search visual content using machine learning. It is available as an IBM Cloud service and can be configured via a web interface, API calls, or several SDKs.

## Use Cases

So, what can you use Watson Visual Recognition for?

*   [Analyze and process video clips](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/enrich-multi-media-files-using-ibm-watson)
*   [Leverage built-in classifiers for scenes, objects, faces, colors and food](https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/create-an-android-calorie-counter-app)
*   <a href="">Create and train your own custom classifier</a>

## IBM Code Patterns related to Watson Visual Recognition

If you're unfamiliar with IBM Code Patterns, they are reproducible examples that are hosted on Github and free to use (they often work on IBM Cloud's free-tier too!).
